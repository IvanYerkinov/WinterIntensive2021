This is an unfinshed for a very basic programming language.

Inputs a textfile of code and outputs a sequence of psuedo assembly instructions.

Within 'main.cpp' replace the string "test.txt" with the name of whatever file you want to parse.

Accepted programming language is very basic. Not all statements and operations are supported yet.
